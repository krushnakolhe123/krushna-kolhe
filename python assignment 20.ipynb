    "Assignment 20 Solutions\n",
    "1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks ?\n",
    "Ans: Both the float and decimal types store numerical values in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use floats when convenience and speed matter. A float gives you an approximation of the number you declare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use decimals when precision matters. Decimals can suffer from their own precision issues, but generally, decimals are more precise than floats. The performance difference between float and decimal, with Python 3, is not outlandish, and in my experience, the precision benefits of a decimal outweigh the performance benefits of a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states ?\n",
    "Ans: Both values are same but internal representation at storage Is different. Precsion differs, Decimal('1.200') gives internally 1.200 and Decimal('1.2') gives 1.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What happens if the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') is checked ?\n",
    "Ans: Both values are checked to be equal , they only differ in precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why is it preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value ?\n",
    "Ans: Floating-point value is converted to Decimal format. Decimal can store float value with absolute precision. But when float value is given as Decimal object,it first has to be converted from floating point value which might already have rounding error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is preferable to start a Decimal object with a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In an arithmetic phrase, how simple is it to combine Decimal objects with integers ?\n",
    "Ans: We can do it with use of Decimal().\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Can Decimal objects and floating-point values be combined easily ?\n",
    "Ans: Arithmetic operfations like Adding,subtracting or multiplying a Decimal object by a floating-point value is generates an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do these operations, the floating point has to be converted to a Decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Using the Fraction class but not the Decimal class, give an example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision ?\n",
    "Ans: Value of 0.5 will be represented as Â½.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Consider the following two fraction objects: Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10). Is the internal state of these two objects the same? Why do you think that is ?\n",
    "Ans: Both will be reduced to 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do the Fraction class and the integer type (int) relate to each other? Containment or inheritance ?\n",
    "Ans: Fraction class and integer type(int) are related in form of a container.It contains two ints, one the numerator and the other the denominator"

    "Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "Ans: Encapsulation describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an objects variable can only be changed by an objects method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "Ans: The Class Attribute is available to all the instance objects of that class. whereas Instance Attributes are accessible only to the object or Instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single copy of Class attributes is maintained by pvm at the class level. Whereas difference copies of instance attributes are maintained by pvm at objects/instance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. When, if ever, can self be included in a class's method definitions?\n",
    "Ans: Yes, self can included in class method definations to access the instance variables inside class methods.\n",

    "Q9. What is the difference between the __add__ and the __radd__ methods ?\n",
    "Ans: Entering __radd__ Python will first try __add__(), and if that returns Not Implemented Python will check if the right-hand operand implements __radd__, and if it does, it will call __radd__() rather than raising a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?\n",
    "Ans: Reflection method we often encounter the requirement that a method in the executing object, or a variable in the calling object, or a field of the object should be assigned, while the method name or field name can not be determined when encoding the code, and need to be input in the form of passing strings through parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the __iadd__ method called?\n",
    "Ans: __iadd__ method is called when we use implementation like a+=b which is a.__iadd__(b)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. Is the _ _init_ _ method inherited by subclasses? What do you do if you need to customize its behavior within a subclass ?\n",
    "Ans: Yes, __init__ method will be inherited by subclasses. if we want to customize its behaviour within a subclass we can use super() method."
